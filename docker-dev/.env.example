# Host gateway IP for Docker containers to access host services
# This is used by containers to communicate with services running on your host machine
#
# Platform-specific values:
#
# === macOS (Docker Desktop) ===
# Use the built-in hostname (no manual IP needed):
HOST_GATEWAY_IP=host.docker.internal
#
# === WSL2 (Windows) ===
# Use the Docker network gateway IP:
# Find it with: docker network inspect docker-dev_default | grep Gateway
# Or: docker network inspect bridge | grep Gateway
# Typically: 172.17.0.1 or 172.18.0.1
# HOST_GATEWAY_IP=172.18.0.1
#
# === Linux (native Docker) ===
# Use the Docker bridge gateway IP:
# Find it with: docker network inspect bridge | grep Gateway
# Typically: 172.17.0.1
# HOST_GATEWAY_IP=172.17.0.1
#
# Uncomment and set the appropriate value for your platform
